# HackNotes

This repository contains my personal notes and tricks that I've gathered while working on various machines in the TryHackMe and HackTheBxo platforms. These notes serve as a guide for penetration testing and help me document my progress and findings.

Please note that these notes are a work in progress, and I'll be continuously adding more content as I progress through the challenges and machines.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a compilation of various tricks, commands, and techniques that can be useful during penetration testing activities. These notes are intended to assist in the process of hacking and securing systems.
